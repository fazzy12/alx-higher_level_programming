## Description
In this project, I continued to practice object-oriented programming in Python.
I learned about class methods, static methods, class vs instance attributes, and
how to use the special `__str__` and `__repr__` methods.


## Key Features
- **Hands-on Projects:** Dive headfirst into real coding projects that mimic real-world scenarios, allowing you to apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations. These projects are your playground for experimentation and implementation.
- **Interactive Learning:** We believe in learning by doing. Each project and challenge is carefully designed to stimulate active learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Expect to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty with code.
- **Gradual Progression:** Learning to code is a journey, and this curriculum is your trusty map. It starts with the basics, ensuring that even those with no prior programming experience can follow along. As you progress, you'll tackle progressively more complex topics, creating a smooth learning curve.
- **Peer Collaboration:** You are not alone on this journey. Join a vibrant community of fellow learners where you can seek help, collaborate on projects, discuss ideas, and celebrate your successes.

## Project: Rectangle Class
### Introduction
The `Rectangle` class project serves as your initiation into the captivating realm of object-oriented programming (OOP) using Python. You'll embark on a journey to construct a Python class that models rectangles, equipped with a suite of functionality to compute properties such as area, perimeter, and more.

### Tasks and Learning Objectives
Each task within this project is meticulously designed to emphasize specific facets of OOP and Python programming. As you progress through these tasks, you will:
- Grasp the core principles of object-oriented programming, a fundamental paradigm widely used in software development.
- Gain hands-on experience in defining and implementing class methods and attributes, laying the foundation for creating robust, reusable code.
- Cultivate the art of writing clean, well-structured code following industry best practices.
- Hone your ability to rigorously test and validate your code to ensure correctness and reliability.

### Usage
To embark on your journey with the `Rectangle` class project, simply navigate to the `rectangle-class-project` directory within this repository. You'll discover comprehensive instructions, code templates, and Python scripts for each task. Execute these scripts to observe the `Rectangle` class in action and validate the correctness of your implementations.

## Challenge: N Queens Puzzle
### Introduction
Are you ready to put your newfound software engineering prowess to the test? The N Queens Puzzle awaits—a classic problem that will push your algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills to their limits.

### Objective
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to strategically place N queens on an N×N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. This deceptively simple yet fiendishly complex challenge demands creativity and precision.

### Solving the Puzzle
The `n-queens-solver` directory houses the resources you need to tackle the N Queens Puzzle head-on. Execute the provided script, providing the value of N as an argument, and watch as algorithmic optimization and systematic problem-solving unfold before your eyes.

## Getting Started
To commence your journey through the Software Engineering Foundations Curriculum, take these initial steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine to access all the course materials.
2. Read the README files within the individual project and challenge directories for detailed guidance.
3. Begin with the `Rectangle` class project if you're new to programming or proceed directly to the N Queens Puzzle challenge if you're ready for a thrilling test of your skills.
