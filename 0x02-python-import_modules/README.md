# Curriculum - 0x02. Python - import & modules

Welcome to the "0x02. Python - import & modules" project repository!

In this project, we delve into the world of importing modules and using Python functions effectively. Explore the power of modular programming and understand how to handle command line arguments. Strengthen your Python skills and learn to organize code efficiently.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, we are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to import functions from another file
- How to use imported functions
- How to create a module
- How to use the built-in function dir()
- How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
- How to use command line arguments with your Python programs

## Copyright - Plagiarism

You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks yourself to meet the learning objectives mentioned above. Remember that plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

General requirements for this project:

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be `interpreted/compiled` on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `python3` `(version 3.8.5)`
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` `(version 2.8.*)`
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks

This project is divided into several tasks, each focused on a specific aspect of importing modules and using functions effectively in `Python`. Complete the tasks to enhance your Python programming skills.
