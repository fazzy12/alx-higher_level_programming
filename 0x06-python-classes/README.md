## My Journey in Learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Welcome to my exploration of Object-Oriented Programming `(OOP)` in Python! In this project, I'll be taking you through various concepts related to `classes and objects`, helping you understand the core principles and practices of `OOP` in `Python`.

## Background Context
Object-Oriented Programming is an essential paradigm in Python that empowers us to create structured and modular code. It's important to grasp the foundational concepts of OOP to build efficient and maintainable software solutions.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I will be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external sources:

## General
- The awesomeness of `Python` programming.
- The fundamental concepts of `Object-Oriented Programming`.
- The concept of "`first-class everything`."
- What a `class` is and how it acts as a blueprint for `objects`.
- The distinction between a `class` and an `object` `(or instance)`.
- The role of `attributes` and their `accessibility levels` `(public, protected, private)`.
- The significance of the `self` keyword in methods.
- The purpose of the special `__init__` method and how to use it.
- The concepts of `Data Abstraction`, `Data Encapsulation`, and `Information Hiding`.
- What a `property` is and how it differs from an attribute in Python.
- The Pythonic way to implement `getters` and `setters`.
- How to dynamically create new attributes for existing `instances and classes`.
- How to `bind attributes to objects and classes`.
- The role and content of the `__dict__` of a `class` `and/or instance`.
- How Python searches for attributes within `objects or classes`.
- How to use the `getattr` function.

## Project Tasks
- In this project, I will be completing several tasks to demonstrate my understanding of OOP. Here's a quick overview of the tasks I will be working on:

`Task 0`: My First Square
- Create an empty `class` called Square that represents a square. I will also learn how to `instantiate` `objects` of this class and examine their attributes.

`Task 1`: Square with Size
- Define a class Square that includes a `private instance attribute` size. I will learn how to create objects with different attributes and access their values.

`Task 2`: Size Validation
- Enhance the Square class by adding `validation` for the size attribute. I will learn how to handle different cases and raise appropriate exceptions.

`Task 3`: Area of a Square
- Add a method to the `Square class` that calculates and returns the area of the square. I will see how to define methods that perform computations based on attributes.

`Task 4`: Access and Update Private Attribute
- Expand the `Square class` with a `property` and a `setter` for the size attribute. I will explore how to control attribute assignments and ensure data integrity.

`Task 5`: Printing a Square
- Implement a method `my_print()` in the `Square class` to print a square of a given size using the `'#' character`. I will learn how to create methods that    manipulate attributes to achieve desired outputs.

`Task 6`: Coordinates of a Square
- Extend the `Square class` with a position attribute that represents the position of the square when printed. I will implement methods to print a square with a specified position.

`Task 7`: Singly Linked List
- Create a `class` Node to define nodes of a singly linked list, and a `class` SinglyLinkedList to define the list structure. I will learn about linked lists and their components.

`Task 8`: Print Square Instance
- Enhance the Square class with a `__str__()` method to provide a string representation of the square when printed. I will explore how to customize the display of objects.

`Task 9`: Compare 2 Squares
- Expand the `Square class` by enabling it to be compared using comparison operators based on the area. I will learn about operator overloading.

`Task 10`: `ByteCode -> Python #5`
- Create a class MagicClass that mimics the behavior of a given Python bytecode. This task will challenge my understanding of bytecode and how it corresponds to Python code.

## Conclusion
As I progress through these tasks, I'll gain a deeper understanding of Object-Oriented Programming in Python. Let's dive into each task, experiment with the concepts, and explore the exciting world of classes and objects!
