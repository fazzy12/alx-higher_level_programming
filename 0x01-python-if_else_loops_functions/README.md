# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
Welcome to the `"0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions"` project repository!

In this project, we dive into the world of conditional statements, loops, and functions in Python. Strengthen your
understanding of decision-making with `if/else` statements, master `loop` structures, and explore the versatility of `Python` functions.

In this project, we explore Python's control flow mechanisms, which are essential for writing flexible and powerful 
programs. Through a series of tasks, we learn how to use `if/else` statements to make decisions based on conditions, 
construct loops `(while and for)` for repetitive tasks, and create functions to organize code and make it reusable.

## Project Tasks
The tasks in this project cover a wide range of concepts related to conditionals, `loops`, and functions in `Python`. Some of the key topics include:

- Working with `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements.
- Using loops `(while and for)` to iterate over data.
- Implementing nested loops and loop control statements `(break and continue)`.
- Creating and calling functions with arguments and return values.
- Understanding function `scope` and `global` variables.

## Usage
In each task's directory, you will find a `Python` script implementing the required functionality. 
Some tasks may also have associated test files to verify the correctness of your solutions.

## Files
The project is organized into separate directories for each task. In each task's directory, 
you will find a Python script containing the code for that task.

## How to Run Tests
To test the functionality of the scripts, navigate to the root directory of the respective 
task and run the test script. The test script is usually named tests.py.

```
python tests.py
```
Make sure you have Python installed and any necessary dependencies available.
