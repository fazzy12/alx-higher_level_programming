# JavaScript - Web scraping

## Overview
This project focuses on JavaScript programming, specifically web scraping. Through a series of tasks, you'll get hands-on experience with manipulating JSON data, working with the request module, and utilizing APIs, especially the Star Wars API.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand why JavaScript programming is exceptional.
- Gain proficiency in manipulating JSON data.
- Familiarize yourself with the request and fetch API.
- Learn how to read and write files using the fs module.

## Prerequisites
**Node.js**: Ensure you have Node 14.x installed. If not, you can install it using the provided commands.

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
**Semi-Standard**: To ensure code consistency, the semi-standard coding style is recommended. Install it globally with:
```
sudo npm install semistandard --global
```
**Request Module**: This module simplifies making HTTP requests and is used extensively in the tasks.

```
sudo npm install request --global
export NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules
```
## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository:

```
