# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

### Overview
This project dives into the fascinating world of sets and dictionaries in Python. It's an exploration 
of these powerful data structures and how they can be harnessed effectively to solve various programming 
challenges. Through a series of tasks and functions, this project provides hands-on experience with manipulating 
sets and dictionaries, as well as utilizing key Python methods like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.

The project includes a folder named "tests," which contains test files provided by Holberton School. 
These tests evaluate the correctness and functionality of the functions developed throughout the project.

## Function Prototypes
Here's a quick reference to the functions implemented in this project, along with their descriptions and use cases:

- [0-square_matrix_simple.py](./0-square_matrix_simple.py): Computes the square value of all integers in a matrix.
- [1-search_replace.py](./1-search_replace.py): Replaces all occurrences of an element in a list with another element.
- [2-uniq_add.py](./2-uniq_add.py): Adds all unique integers in a list (without duplication).
- [3-common_elements.py](./3-common_elements.py): Returns a set of common elements between two sets.
- [4-only_diff_elements.py](4-only_diff_elements.py): Returns a set of elements present in only one of two sets.
- [5-number_keys.py](./5-number_keys.py): Returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
- [6-print_sorted_dictionary.py](./6-print_sorted_dictionary.py): Prints a dictionary with keys sorted in alphabetic order.
- [7-update_dictionary.py](./7-update_dictionary.py): Updates a dictionary by adding or replacing key-value pairs.
- [8-simple_delete.py](./8-simple_delete.py): Deletes a key from a dictionary.
- [9-multiply_by_2.py](./9-multiply_by_2.py): Returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
- [10-best_score.py](./10-best_score.py): Returns the key with the highest integer value in a dictionary.
- [11-mutiply_list_map.py](./11-multiply_list_map.py): Returns a list with values multiplied by a number using map.
- [12-roman_to_int.py](./12-roman_to_int.py): Converts a Roman numeral to an integer.
- [100-weight_average.py](./100-weight_average.py): Calculates the weighted average of integers in a list of tuples.
- [101-square_matrix_map.py](./101-square_matrix_map.py): Computes the square value of matrix integers using map.
- [102-complex_delete.py](./102-complex_delete.py): Deletes keys with a specific value from a dictionary.
- [103-python.c](./103-python.c): C functions that provide information about Python lists and bytes objects.

## Curriculum

This project is part of the SE Foundations curriculum at Holberton School. It falls under the "Python - 
More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary" section and contributes to the learning objectives of u
nderstanding sets, dictionaries, lambda functions, and Python's map, reduce, and filter functions.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:

* Understand the advantages of Python programming.
* Utilize sets and dictionaries effectively.
* Implement common methods of sets and dictionaries.
* Choose between sets, dictionaries, and lists for different scenarios.
* Iterate over sets and dictionaries using appropriate techniques.
* Apply lambda functions and explore the map, reduce, and filter functions.

# Requirements
* Supported editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
* All files `interpreted/compiled` on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5`
* Files end with a new line and start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file at the project's root folder is mandatory
* Code should follow the `PEP 8` style guidelines `(check with pycodestyle)`
* All files must be `executable`
* Code length is tested using `wc`
* Various quizzes and tests are included to assess your understanding and progress.
