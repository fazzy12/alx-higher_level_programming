# Higher-level Programming - Python, Databases & JavaScript

## introduction
Welcome to the Higher-level Programming repository! This repository contains a collection of programs and projects completed during 
the higher-level programming track at Holberton School. Throughout these projects, I've gained proficiency in Python, MySQL, and JavaScript. 
Additionally, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell scripting. Below is a list of the specific projects contained in this repository:
