# CPython #0: Python Lists
`CPython` is the reference implementation of the `Python` programming language, written in `C`. This task involves creating a `C` function that provides some basic information about `Python lists`. By examining the underlying `C` implementation of `Python`, we can gain insights into how `lists` work in the language.

## Task Details
Create a `C` function called `print_python_list_info` that prints information about a `Python list`. The details to be printed include:

- Size of the Python List (number of elements)
- Allocated memory (number of slots)
- Type of elements in the list

The provided Python version for this task is `3.4``. The shared library containing the `C` function will be compiled using the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c99 -shared -Wl,-soname,PyList -o libPyList.so -fPIC -I/usr/include/python3.4 100-print_python_list_info.c
```
The `Python` `script` `100-test_lists.py` demonstrates the usage of the `C` `function`. It creates and manipulates `Python lists`, calling the `print_python_list_info` function to display relevant information about the `lists`.

## How to Run

Compile the shared library:
````
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c99 -shared -Wl,-soname,PyList -o libPyList.so -fPIC -I/usr/include/python3.4 100-print_python_list_info.c
````
Run the Python script:

``````
python3 100-test_lists.py
``````
The output of the script will display information about the Python `lists` created and manipulated using the `C` function.

## Requirements

- `C` compiler `(gcc)`
- `Python 3.4`
- `ctypes` library (used for interfacing with shared `C` libraries in `Python`)

## Additional Information
This task offers insights into the inner workings of Python lists by examining their C-level implementation. By understanding how lists are structured and allocated in memory, we can appreciate the efficiency and versatility of this fundamental data structure in Python.
